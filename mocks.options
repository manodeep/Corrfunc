### Special option for DDrppi_mocks/DDsmu_mocks
OPT += -DOUTPUT_RPAVG  ### Enabling this DOES NOT cause too much of a runtime-hit for DDrppi (<= 10% performance hit)
#OPT += -DFAST_DIVIDE=2 ##replaces a divide with approximate reciprocals, followed by 'FAST_DIVIDE' number of Newton-Raphson steps. Trade-off between speed and accuracy; may be slower on newer computers

### Specific options for wtheta (DDtheta_mocks.c)
#OPT += -DOUTPUT_THETAAVG
OPT += -DLINK_IN_DEC
OPT += -DLINK_IN_RA #link_in_dec must be enabled before link_in_ra
#OPT += -DFAST_ACOS ## replaces acos by an 8th order REMEZ polynomial. Results are approximate (max. absolute error 3.6e-9) ~50% boost, but obviously approximate

#### Floating point precision to use
OPT += -DDOUBLE_PREC

#### If input distances are already in co-moving (relevant for DDrppi_mocks and vpf)
#OPT += -DCOMOVING_DIST
