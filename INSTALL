Steps:

1. cd into xi_theory directory 

2. Edit the common.mk file to select the appropriate use-case.

Science options are:
		a) PERIODIC -- disable to stop PERIODIC boundaries. Enabled by default, wp subdir will ignore this flag and *always* use PERIODIC boundary conditions.
		b) OUTPUT_RPAVG -- enable to output the average rp in each bin. Disabled by default, runtime will increase significantly if you enable this option (DOUBLE_PREC has to enabled as well for OUTPUT_RPAVG to work)

Code options are:
		 a) DOUBLE_PREC -- enable to calculate in double precision. Disabled by default - runtime will increase at most 2x
		 b) USE_AVX -- disable to fall-back to slow code supported on the current platform. Runtime can increase by an order of magnitude if you disable this option
		 c) USE_OMP -- disable to use single threaded code rather than OpenMP parallel code. Runtime will (obviously) increase in single-thread mode.


3. Set the compiler in common.mk -- icc/gcc/clang are supported in serial mode. Only gcc and icc are supported with OpenMP parallelization. 

4. Type make to create all the executables

5. Type make install to copy the executables into the bin subdirectory

6. Type make lib to create libraries for each type of clustering measure. Right now, you will have manually recompile (i.e., make clean && make && make lib ) if you
want a different setup for the correlation function measure. So, if you want to change PERIODIC boundary conditions, let's say, you will have to change the
corresponding option in common.mk, make clean, make and finally make lib to access the libraries with the new functionality.
