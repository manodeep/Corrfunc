Problems with the python interface on MAC:

1. You are getting the error message "Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread"
when you do "python call_correlation_functions.py"

This is usually caused by a python library mis-match between linking time and run-time, i.e., 
the python shared extension (_countpairs.so in the python_bindings/ subdir) was built with a
python lib version that is not the first one in your search path. The way I resolved it on 
my MAC was by adding the path: "python-config --prefix"/lib to the dynamic library 
path environment variable. 

In my case, I use the anaconda distribution for python at link-time but I pick 
up the macports install at run-time. The exact command to fix the situation is:

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/manodeep/anaconda/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

where, "/Users/manodeep/anaconda/" is the output of "python-config --prefix".
