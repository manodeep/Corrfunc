#### Science use-cases for Theory Correlation Functions
OPT = -DPERIODIC
#OPT += -DOUTPUT_RPAVG  ### Enabling this can cause up to a 2x performance hit
#OPT += -DFAST_DIVIDE=2 ##replaces a divide (in DDsmu) with approximate reciprocals, followed by 'FAST_DIVIDE' number of Newton-Raphson steps. Trade-off between speed and accuracy; may be slower on newer computers

#### Code specs for both theory and data Correlation Functions
#OPT += -DDOUBLE_PREC
