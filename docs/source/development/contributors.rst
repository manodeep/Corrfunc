* Corrfunc contains code from `Agner Fog <https://agner.org>`_, `GeometricTools
  <http://www.geometrictools.com/>`_, and the package `SGLIB
  <http://sglib.sourceforge.net/>`_. The LICENSE for these external files
  remains with the original author of the package.

* The entirety of the docs for Corrfunc is derived from `Halotools
  <https://github.com/astropy/halotools>`_. I know, first-hand, how much of an
  effort it was for the developers of `Halotools` to generate all of this
  documentation. Having such a template made creating the docs for Corrfunc a
  lot easier process. The API generation script for Corrfunc was lifter
  directly out of the repo `bccp/nbodykit/ <https://github.com/bccp/nbodykit/>`_.
