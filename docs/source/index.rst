Corrfunc Documentation
=======================

Corrfunc is a set of high-performance routines to measure clustering statistics.
The main features of Corrfunc are:

* **Fast** All theory pair-counting is at least an order of magnitude faster than all existing public codes. Particularly suited for MCMC.
* **OpenMP Parallel** All pair-counting codes can be done in parallel (with strong scaling efficiency >~ 95% up to 10 cores)
* **Python Extensions** Python extensions allow you to do the compute-heavy bits using C while retaining all of the user-friendliness of python.
* **Modular** The code is written in a modular fashion and is easily extensible to compute arbitrary clustering statistics.
* **Future-proof** As I get access to newer instruction-sets, the codes will
  get updated to use the latest and greatest CPU features. 

The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc.
