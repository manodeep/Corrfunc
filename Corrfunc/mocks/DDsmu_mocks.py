    """
    Calculate the 2-D pair-counts corresponding to the projected correlation
    function, :math:`\\xi(s, \mu)`. The pairs are counted in bins of
    radial separation and cosine of angle to the line-of-sight (LOS). The
    input positions are expected to be on-sky co-ordinates. This module is
    suitable for calculating correlation functions for mock catalogs.

    If ``weights`` are provided, the resulting pair counts are weighted.  The
    weighting scheme depends on ``weight_type``.

    Returns a numpy structured array containing the pair counts for the
    specified bins.


    .. note:: This module only returns pair counts and not the actual
       correlation function :math:`\\xi(s, \mu)`. See the
       utilities :py:mod:`Corrfunc.utils.convert_3d_counts_to_cf`
       for computing :math:`\\xi(s, \mu)` from the pair counts.

    .. versionadded:: 2.1.0

    Parameters
    ----------

    autocorr: boolean, required
        Boolean flag for auto/cross-correlation. If autocorr is set to 1,
        then the second set of particle positions are not required.

    cosmology: integer, required
        Integer choice for setting cosmology. Valid values are 1->LasDamas
        cosmology and 2->Planck cosmology. If you need arbitrary cosmology,
        easiest way is to convert the ``CZ`` values into co-moving distance,
        based on your preferred cosmology. Set ``is_comoving_dist=True``, to
        indicate that the co-moving distance conversion has already been done.

        Choices:
                 1. LasDamas cosmology. :math:`\\Omega_m=0.25`, :math:`\\Omega_\Lambda=0.75`
                 2. Planck   cosmology. :math:`\\Omega_m=0.302`, :math:`\\Omega_\Lambda=0.698`

        To setup a new cosmology, add an entry to the function,
        ``init_cosmology`` in ``ROOT/utils/cosmology_params.c`` and re-install
        the entire package.

    nthreads: integer
        The number of OpenMP threads to use. Has no effect if OpenMP was not
        enabled during library compilation.

    mu_max: double. Must be in range [0.0, 1.0]
        A double-precision value for the maximum cosine of the angular
        separation from the line of sight (LOS). Here, ``mu`` is defined as
        the angle between ``s`` and ``l``. If :math:`v_1` and :math:`v_2`
        represent the vectors to each point constituting the pair, then
        :math:`s := v_1 - v_2` and :math:`l := 1/2 (v_1 + v_2)`.

        Note: Only pairs with :math:`0 <= \cos(\\theta_{LOS}) < \mu_{max}`
        are counted (no equality).

    nmu_bins: int
        The number of linear ``mu`` bins, with the bins ranging from
        from (0, :math:`\mu_{max}`)

    binfile: string or an list/array of floats
        For string input: filename specifying the ``s`` bins for
        ``DDsmu_mocks``. The file should contain white-space separated values
        of (smin, smax) specifying each ``s`` bin wanted. The bins
        need to be contiguous and sorted in increasing order (smallest bins
        come first).

        For array-like input: A sequence of ``s`` values that provides the
        bin-edges. For example,
        ``np.logspace(np.log10(0.1), np.log10(10.0), 15)`` is a valid
        input specifying **14** (logarithmic) bins between 0.1 and 10.0. This
        array does not need to be sorted.

    RA1: array-like, real (float/double)
        The array of Right Ascensions for the first set of points. RA's
        are expected to be in [0.0, 360.0], but the code will try to fix cases
        where the RA's are in [-180, 180.0]. For peace of mind, always supply
        RA's in [0.0, 360.0].

        Calculations are done in the precision of the supplied arrays.

    DEC1: array-like, real (float/double)
        Array of Declinations for the first set of points. DEC's are expected
        to be in the [-90.0, 90.0], but the code will try to fix cases where
        the DEC's are in [0.0, 180.0]. Again, for peace of mind, always supply
        DEC's in [-90.0, 90.0].

        Must be of same precision type as RA1.

    CZ1: array-like, real (float/double)
        Array of (Speed Of Light * Redshift) values for the first set of
        points. Code will try to detect cases where ``redshifts`` have been
        passed and multiply the entire array with the ``speed of light``.

        If is_comoving_dist is set, then ``CZ1`` is interpreted as the
        co-moving distance, rather than `cz`.

    weights1: array_like, real (float/double), optional
        A scalar, or an array of weights of shape (n_weights, n_positions)
        or (n_positions,). `weight_type` specifies how these weights are used;
        results are returned in the `weightavg` field.  If only one of
        ``weights1`` or ``weights2`` is specified, the other will be set
        to uniform weights.

    RA2: array-like, real (float/double)
        The array of Right Ascensions for the second set of points. RA's
        are expected to be in [0.0, 360.0], but the code will try to fix cases
        where the RA's are in [-180, 180.0]. For peace of mind, always supply
        RA's in [0.0, 360.0].

        Must be of same precision type as RA1/DEC1/CZ1.

    DEC2: array-like, real (float/double)
        Array of Declinations for the second set of points. DEC's are expected
        to be in the [-90.0, 90.0], but the code will try to fix cases where
        the DEC's are in [0.0, 180.0]. Again, for peace of mind, always supply
        DEC's in [-90.0, 90.0].

        Must be of same precision type as RA1/DEC1/CZ1.

    CZ2: array-like, real (float/double)
        Array of (Speed Of Light * Redshift) values for the second set of
        points. Code will try to detect cases where ``redshifts`` have been
        passed and multiply the entire array with the ``speed of light``.

        If is_comoving_dist is set, then ``CZ2`` is interpreted as the
        co-moving distance, rather than `cz`.

        Must be of same precision type as RA1/DEC1/CZ1.

    weights2: array-like, real (float/double), optional
        Same as weights1, but for the second set of positions

    is_comoving_dist: boolean (default false)
        Boolean flag to indicate that ``cz`` values have already been
        converted into co-moving distances. This flag allows arbitrary
        cosmologies to be used in ``Corrfunc``.

    verbose: boolean (default false)
        Boolean flag to control output of informational messages

    output_savg: boolean (default false)
        Boolean flag to output the average ``s`` for each bin. Code will
        run slower if you set this flag. Also, note, if you are calculating
        in single-precision, ``savg`` will suffer from numerical loss of
        precision and can not be trusted. If you need accurate ``savg``
        values, then pass in double precision arrays for the particle
        positions.

    fast_divide_and_NR_steps: integer (default 0)
        Replaces the division in ``AVX`` implementation with an approximate
        reciprocal, followed by ``fast_divide_and_NR_steps`` of Newton-Raphson.
        Can improve runtime by ~15-20% on older computers. Value of 0 uses
        the standard division operation.

    (xyz)bin_refine_factor: integer, default is (2,2,1); typically within [1-3]
        Controls the refinement on the cell sizes. Can have up to a 20% impact
        on runtime.

    max_cells_per_dim: integer, default is 100, typical values in [50-300]
        Controls the maximum number of cells per dimension. Total number of
        cells can be up to (max_cells_per_dim)^3. Only increase if ``rpmax`` is
        too small relative to the boxsize (and increasing helps the runtime).

    copy_particles: boolean (default True)
        Boolean flag to make a copy of the particle positions
        If set to False, the particles will be re-ordered in-place

        .. versionadded:: 2.3.0

    enable_min_sep_opt: boolean (default true)
        Boolean flag to allow optimizations based on min. separation between
        pairs of cells. Here to allow for comparison studies.

        .. versionadded:: 2.3.0

    c_api_timer: boolean (default false)
        Boolean flag to measure actual time spent in the C libraries. Here
        to allow for benchmarking and scaling studies.

    isa: string, case-insensitive (default ``fastest``)
       Controls the runtime dispatch for the instruction set to use. Options
       are: [``fastest``, ``avx512f``, ``avx``, ``sse42``, ``fallback``]

       Setting isa to ``fastest`` will pick the fastest available instruction
       set on the current computer. However, if you set ``isa`` to, say,
       ``avx`` and ``avx`` is not available on the computer, then the code will
       revert to using ``fallback`` (even though ``sse42`` might be available).

       Unless you are benchmarking the different instruction sets, you should
       always leave ``isa`` to the default value. And if you *are*
       benchmarking, then the string supplied here gets translated into an
       ``enum`` for the instruction set defined in ``utils/defs.h``.

    weight_type: string, optional (default None)
        The type of weighting to apply.  One of ["pair_product", None].

    Returns
    --------

    results: Numpy structured array
        A numpy structured array containing [smin, smax, savg, mumax,
        npairs, weightavg]. There are a total of ``nmu_bins`` in ``mu``
        for each separation bin specified in the ``binfile``, with ``mumax``
        being the upper limit of the ``mu`` bin. If ``output_savg`` is  not
        set, then ``savg`` will be set to 0.0 for all bins; similarly for
        ``weightavg``. ``npairs`` contains the number of pairs in that bin
        and can be used to compute the actual :math:`\\xi(s, \mu)` by
        combining with (DR, RR) counts.

    api_time: float, optional
        Only returned if ``c_api_timer`` is set.  ``api_time`` measures only
        the time spent within the C library and ignores all python overhead.
