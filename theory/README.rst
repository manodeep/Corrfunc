Description
------------

This `theory` directory contains a set of codes to measure the following correlation measures in a cosmological box: 

- `DD` Measures auto/cross-correlation pair-counts between two boxes. Can be used to make full 3-d correlation function --  $\xi(r)$

- `DDrppi` Measures the auto/cross-correlation pair-counts between two boxes. Can be used to make projected correlation function $\xi(r_p, \pi)$

- `wp` Measures the full 2-point projected auto-correlation ($w_p(r_p)$) function in a periodic cosmological box. 

- `xi` Measures the full 2-point 3D auto-correlation function ($\xi(r)$) in a periodic cosmological box. 

- `DDsmu` Measures the auto/cross-correlation pair-counts between two boxes. Can be used to make the $\xi(s, \mu)$

- `vpf` Measures the counts-in-cell stats $pN(r)$, where $p0(r)$ is the *Void Probability function* `(vpf)`
