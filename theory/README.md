This contains a set of codes to measure the following
three correlation measures in a cosmological box: 

1. Measures auto/cross-correlations between two boxes. 
Can be used to make full 3-d correlation function --  $\xi(r)$
Codes are in `DD` sub-directory.

2. Measures the auto/cross-correlations between two boxes.
Can be used to make projected correlation function -- $\xi(r_p,\pi)$
Codes are in the `DDrppi` sub-directory.

3. Measures the full 2-point projected auto-correlation function
in a periodic cosmological box. Codes are in the `wp` sub-directory.

4. Measures the full 2-point 3D auto-correlation function
in a periodic cosmological box. Codes are in the `xi` sub-directory.

5. Measures the counts-in-cell stats. Codes are in the `vpf` sub-directory
