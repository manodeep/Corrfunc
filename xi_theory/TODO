*/

1. Update libraries to contain all possible common.mk options (i.e., all options for PERIODIC, OUTPUT_RPAVG, DOUBLE_PREC, USE_AVX, USE_OMP).
Should be possible with some pre-processor abuse. 

2. Change the cellarray structure to be more cache-friendly -- instead of 3 different pointers to X/Y/Z, have a single pointer pos that contains X[CACHE_LINE_SIZE] Y[CACHE_LINE_SIZE] Z[CACHE_LINE_SIZE]. In
the other xi_of_r repo, a similar change (with chunks of AVX_NVEC (4 double or 8 floats) gave perfect scaling.

3. Use CBLAS libraries for non-periodic boundary conditions. Or YEPPP (http://yeppp.info/) 

4. Add code for GPU's.
