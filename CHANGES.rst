2.4.0 (2021-09-30)

  extent in periodic theory boxes. Applies to Python, command line, and C API.
  The order of some Python keyword args has also changed. [#199]

- Add lscpu and preprocessor defs to CI output [#259]

  now required for every statistic (`#73 <https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc/issues/73>`_)


Enhancements
------------

- Ctrl-C now aborts even within python extensions (cleans up memory too!, `see issue #12 <https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc/issues/12>`_)
- Significantly improved installation for python

  - compiler can now be specified within ``python setup.py install CC=yourcompiler``
    `(see issue #31) <https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc/issues/31>`_
  - python via an alias is now solved `#52 <https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc/issues/52>`_


Bug fixes
----------

  be 1 `#70 <https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc/issues/70>`_



Outstanding issues
-------------------
- Conda package still is pending (`#49 <https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc/issues/49>`_)
- Recursive Makefile needs to be replaced with
  a more monolithic Makefile (`#14 <https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc/issues/14>`_)
- Parameter parsing in python extensions can be flaky (`#79 <https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc/issues/79>`_)
